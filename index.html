          Having good physical health is an important factor in your life
          because it decreases the risk of dangerous diseases and illnesses.
          There are many benefits of having good physical health. For example,
          your overall function and way you work can improve positively.
          Although you may not be aware of it, having good physical health plays
          a very important role in how you breathe and how all the vital organs
          and bones in your body function. Having stable physical health is very
          important to be working at your peak. There are many ways to make sure
          that your physical health is at its finest. For example, there is an
          enormous variety of food that can help you maintain a balanced diet,
          thus positively impacting your physical health.

          <h3>What is the meaning/definition of Physical Health?</h3>
          <p>
            The meaning of physical health is that your body is functioning and
            working properly. Which means that you are able to move your body,
            run, walk, and all your organs are working as they should. Most
            people say that physical health is about your body being disease
            free or disability free but as healthcare has improved and people
            have started to live longer this definition is now a lie. Physical
            Health associates with Mental Health because physical health has a
            feeling of living long-term.

          <h3>Why should you be careful about your Physical Health?</h3>
          <p class="p-list">
            Being Healthy is a part of life but the problem is that we forget
            about our body. Our body holds our spirit and our spirit is
            important as much as the body is. There are many problems if you
            don’t take care of your body such as:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Heart disease</li>
            <li>Cancer</li>
            <li>Chronic respiratory disease</li>
            <li>Accidents</li>
            <li>Strokes</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The first three of them are because of Physical Health. These are
            not the only 5 things you could die from you could also die from
            your Physical body not moving, incapacitated or died from sickness.
            This is why you should be careful about your Physical body but you
            should also watch what you put in your body and eat something
            healthy. So take care of your Physical health and remember this: IF
            YOU DON’T CHANGE YOUR LIFE, YOUR LIFE WILL CHANGE YOU and stay
            healthy.
