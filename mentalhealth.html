            Mental health isn’t just about not having depression and anxiety
            it’s also about making sure you're enjoying life. Mental health
            affects everyone when they are not happy for a long time. Sometimes
            mental health can get very bad to the point where you have to take
            medications for it. Mental health is connected to physical health
            because when a person is down, they stop going out and taking care
            of their hygiene. Mental health affects teens more than it does
            adults.

            What is good mental health? Good mental health is being in a safe,
            secure mindset. Conditions such as stress, anxiety isolation and
            more, can affect your mental health. Unstable mental health could
            cause depression, family and friend conflict and more. Anyone is in
            risk of developing mental health disorders, so it is important that
            you take care of and prevent this from happening. Stay healthy and
            Alert.

          <h3>What can cause Mental Health issues?</h3>
          <p>
            There are many things that cause Mental Health for example, social
            isolation or loneliness, bereavement (losing someone close to you),
            long-term stress, and having a long-term physical health condition.

            What are some solutions to help mental health and why can bad mental
            health be dangerous?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Since everyone's body, mind and well-being are different, there are
            many options that can help mental health. Such as, talk to a
            therapist, psychotherapy (psychotherapy is the therapeutic treatment
            of mental illness provided by a trained mental health professional),
            Support Group (a support is a group of people who have problems and
            the host there can help them). Bad Mental Health can be dangerous
            because that people can be so depressed or stress that they would
            want to commit suicide. When this person does this you would have to
            put them in a mental hospital.
